FAVICON SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
==========================

I've configured the site to use "favicon.png" as the tab icon.

To complete the setup:
1. Save your JA hexagon logo image as "favicon.png" in the root directory
2. Recommended size: 512x512 pixels or 256x256 pixels
3. PNG format with transparent background works best

The HTML files already include:
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="favicon.png">

Once you upload favicon.png to the root directory, it will automatically appear
as your website's tab icon in browsers.

Alternative formats:
- You can also use .ico format and rename to "favicon.ico"
- If using .ico, update the HTML to: <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
